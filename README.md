I am a systems engineer graduated from Universidad Americana (UAM) with knowledge in Python, HTML, CSS, JS, React, VB and Pentesting, in this repository you can find my projects.

I will give you a brief description of my projects:

# Car quoter

This is a Python application made with Tkinter as GUI that works using Selenium to automate the actions taken by employees to quote a car, it looks for information from the National Registry, TSE and CR Autos to enter it in the platform of some insurers such as Lafise, Qualitas, INS and Oceanica, it uses Joblib to do parallel tasks.

# Automatic dashboard in excel

We wanted to be faster with the report we were giving to companies on the status of their Occupational Risk Insurance so we used Visual Basic with Excel so that with the raw data and a shortcut we could process the data and generate graphs.
